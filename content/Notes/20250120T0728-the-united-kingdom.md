According to a BBC-sponsored survey in 2013, there are seven different social classes, and the level of education and type of job are no longer as closely related as before.

Someone with a university degree could have difficulty finding a job, and end up working at McDonald's, with a low income.

The lower class is now the traditional working class, new workers in the service sectors, and the poorest workers with low education and the most insecure jobs, many of the unemployed.
The lowest class is called the "precariat", and it 15% of the population.
25% belong to the middle class and 14% to the traditional working class.
