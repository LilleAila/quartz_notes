# black lives matter

In 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing a bus driver's instructions to give up her seat to a white passenger. Her bravery led to nationwide efforts to end racial segregation.

Instead of standing up to show pride, Colin Kaepernick (centre) kneels with teammates during the national anthem before an NFL football game in 2016. “Taking the knee” was a protest from Kaepernick against police brutality towards black Americans. Many black athletes soon followed his example.

\#BlackLivesMatter is a movement fighting police brutality and racism.
The movement began on Twitter in ==2013==. The original post was a response to the acquittal ==(Did not face any charges)== of **George Zimmerman**, a neighborhood watch volunteer who shot an unarmed 17-year-old named **Trayvon Martin**. For many people, this was yet another example of **racial profiling** resulting in the death of innocent African Americans where the people responsible did not face any charges. The hashtag \#BlackLivesMatter was used as a response to the lack of justice in this case.

> **Racial Profiling**: The practice by the police of thinking that people of a particular race or colour will behave in a particular way, especially that they commit crimes.

In 2013, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Ayo Tometi created a racial justice organization building on what had become the popular social media hashtag \#BlackLivesMatter in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman. Their work, alongside the work of Black activists across the country, helped spur a social movement that spread across the world and has shaped the fight for racial justice, economic equality, and gender equity over the past decade.

**George Floyd** killed in May 2020, new wave of protests. Police thought he used fake money. The attention received through activity on social media and in demonstrations has led many people to call this “the new civil rights movement”.
