Everyone has cognitive biases. That is how our brain filters all the information we consume. We choose things based on personal experience, beliefs and values, and it can be hard to alter one's opinion even when presented with good evidence.

Sometimes these preexisting views are created because that is the first impression that we get when learning about it, and is hard to change even as we learn more about the topic. Views are usually reinforced rather than challenged on social media. We like to get our own views confirmed, so our brain will look for information that matches our own ideas. In addition, instinct makes ut pay more attention to negative information than to positive or neutral information, which explains why bad news often sell more.

The media is often criticized for their political bias. Some outlets explicitly tell the user that they are "conservative", "progressive", etc, which usually mean right and left wing respectively. When everyone has their own viewpoints and opinions, it becomes nearly impossible to tell a story _without_ any personal bias.

Honesty, fairness and accountability are the gold standards in journalism, but they are very easy to ignore when posting something on the internet.

## Bias in the news media (unibok p. 125, NDLA)

- Accuracy
  - An article can be incomplete and missing some information or accuracy, where they make it seem like one side is better than the other by omitting some things or not fact-checking.
- Omission
  - Omitting information that can be bad or incriminating for one side of the story.
- Bias by selection or placement
  - Placing specific articles higher up and altering the titles ("clickbait") to entice readers to click on the articles and give them more money.
- Sensationalism
  - Using loaded and exaggerated language to make a story more interesting
- Subjective language
- Loaded language
  - Using stronger words to provoke stronger feelings in the readers.

All journalists have culture and traditions, which makes it very hard to be subjective about what they are writing about. They might see some other culture's tradition as wrong in some way, while this culture might think the opposite. This makes it very hard to be impartial when writing an article.

Some countries practice censorship, and are denied the right to speak the truth. Some countries openly practice censorship, while in others like Russia, journalists have been killed.

In addition, the inherent bias of the consumers of media leads to the media wanting to write more about this so that they can make more money. This leads to a sort of feedback loop, resulting in the news being not as relevant, but easier to consume as entertainment instead of a way to learn more about our society.

### Keywords

- Impartial
- Culture
- Money (news as entertainment)
- More important stories don't get covered
- Censorship and government-controlled media
- Undemocratic

### Example video

> Find the words and/or phrases that you think are biased.

"Expose his extremist agenda using facts and reason"

Making fun of Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

Biden supporters:
"Trump wants to beat up Biden"

Trump supporters:
"Donald trump standing up to Joe Biden"

"You can not defend that statement" Newt Gingrich is very defensive.

Newspapers from both sides were the except opposites.

"Donald trump has a vocabulary of 200", a lot of articles created to make fun of the other political party, but most of it were by trump-supporters making fun of Joe Biden.

### Example article / video Xinjiang

"Minorities have been drafted into forced labor" _could_ be a form of bias

The accuracy of the video is not very good because they only interviewed one of the people that were there. In addition, the interviewee likely omitted some parts from what they said. They also only focused on the bad parts of what they talked about in the video, and not about any of the good things, using sensationalism and loaded language to highlight the bad parts. A lot of the languages used was subjective because they only had one good interview, in addition to two of them who were under surveillance at the time.
