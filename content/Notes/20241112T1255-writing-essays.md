It's very important to proofread the text after finishing it.

Avoid contractions in academic writings. ex. "it's"

## Introduction

The introduction is very important, to grab your reader's attention.

Example:
Can you name one aspect of your life that would not be affected if the modern forms of communications suddenly stopped working? Imagine if one day, your social media platforms were down, your local newspaper was no longer available online, or your daily video call with your family abroad did not go through. How would this affect your life? It is hard to imagine, right? Communication is...

## Linking words

Added linking words are ==highlighted==.

**However**, new forms of communication have some negative aspects. ==For instance,== some claim the accessibility of social media has gone too far, and that the newer generations are getting addicted to it. ==In addition,== many would even go as far as to say that social media can be damaging to real communication, by being a distraction to forming real life connections. Were relationships stronger before the internet arrived? Moreover, it can also be easier to hide our true feelings and intentions when we sit behind a screen. This is close to impossible in face-to-face communication. It can be hard to distinguish what is true and what is false in communication over the internet, and this could potentially be dangerous in many situations. Here, real communications have an upper hand. ==To conclude,== real communication is a better option when looking at these viewpoints.

### Improving my own text

Jeg bare sånn ==highlighter== alt jeg la til nå og sånn linking words

Social media is meant to remove this one-way street and the slow process of giving feedback and sharing what you want to, and allowing for instant communication. ==Moreover==, there are various platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and many more. This type of media is much more accessible ==than traditional media==. Anyone can create a post and write about whatever they want to. This leads to a large amount of information available, which is too much for one person to read. Because of this, the social media platforms have developed algorithms intended to give the users more relevant posts, and to keep them on the app for as long as possible. ==On the contrary==, this can lead to a concept known as a filter bubble, where the posts with differing opinions, for example political opinions, get filtered out from their feeds. ==Subsequently==, they are fed with more and more opinions from one side, while the opposition gets filtered out. This leads to an echo chamber where they can end up with being shown only extremist content that is not healthy for them. ==Furthermore==, such algorithms are created to keep users interested for as long as possible. This means that social media can become highly addictive, and people can spend too much time using it, which takes time away from more important things such as studying or socializing.

I often have a tendency to begin most sentences with "this", and should be more conscious about attempting to use a wider variety of linking words throughout my compositions.

#### Updated text with more linking words

@ildenh legg til ting under der og ==hailait det== pls
nah bro gjorde det ikke :sob: :pray:

## Using examples

While using examples, it's vital to help the reader understand _how_ your examples connect to your thesis statement and _why_ they matter.

"Example sandwich"

- Introduce your example
- Present your example
- Analyze or reflect on your example

\1. Short introduction of the example.
\2. Presenting the example
\3. Analyzing and reflecting the example

### Good example of example usage

==Echo chambers are harmful==. Imagine yourself in a dark cave. Your words echo back to you whenever you talk. At some point, you will be completely isolated from any outside communication. This is how many people experience social media. ==Let’s use an example to make this easier.== Philip Manshaus was a Norwegian teenager. He was lonely for his age and used social media as an escape. There, he found forums and group chats discussing Norwegian nationalism. ==Him being stuck== in this rabbit hole of ==extremism ideologies==, bias and prejudice, ==lead== him to spiral into a psychosis where he ==at the end== committed the murder of his adopted sister from China. ==This example shows how lacking knowledge can hurt people around you. If only he had been critical and if only, he was not affected by the echo chamber, he wouldn’t act so inhumanly.==

Introducing the example with "let's use an example"
Presenting the example _IN DETAIL_ (1-2 sentences is _not_ enough). Presenting from "Philip", to "China".
End with a short summary, analysis and reflection

## Ending

![20241112T1336-essay-ending.png](Assets/20241112T1336-essay-ending.png)

Ending should sum up the main points of the essay, and have a closing statement as the last tentence.

### My ending

How has the development of the media impacted our lives? The development of the media and communication over the years can be regarded as both a negative and a positive evolution. The traditional media acts as a one-way street, where the information is shared from the editors, without the ability to easily give feedback on what is published. Social media is the opposite of this, being similar to a two-way street where both the original creators of the post and the readers can communicate directly with each other through comments and messages. It has also opened up for the possibility of talking to others all over the world and to quickly communicate with friends while at home. On one hand, this is a positive development, because in theory, it allows us to easily share, consume and give feedback on information, and to get to know people with similar interest from all over the world, but on the other hand, cyberbullying is very prominent online, which can be detrimental for the mental health of social media users. In addition, the internet is full of disinformation, misinformation and bias, so it is important to be media literate and critical of everything we read on the internet.

### Example ending from teacher

==In conclusion==, bias is everywhere, manifesting itself not only in the news media, but also in a societal context. Altering news to fit a certain narrative only ends up harming people, creating places on the internet where independent thinking is not encouraged. Cognitive bias hinders our ability to understand people, and according to the Daniel-Kruger effect only inflates our limited supposed knowledge. ==Although== our human instincts keep us safe, it is important to question our innate assumptions. We can challenge our prejudices through sound journalism, which aims to inform us the people. ==Ultimately==, a little knowledge truly is a dangerous thing. Let us all attempt to let go of our bias, to dismantle our prejudices, and look beyond, let us look for true objectivity!

Alternative, improved closing statement
Let us strive to let go of our biases, dismantle our prejudices, and seek true objectivity!
