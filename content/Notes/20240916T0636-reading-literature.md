## Approaching a factual text

Starting by activating prior knowledge, scanning through the text, then read through the details.

### Before reading

==**_HIPIC_**== - Quickly look through

- **H**eadings and subheadings
- **I**ntroduction
- **P**ictures
- **I**mportant words
- **C**onclusion

Sum up the findings and try predicting what the text will be about.

### While reading

**The three-times technique**: Read the first sentence in the paragraph slowly and carefully. It usually introduces the main idea of the following paragraph.

**Read and remember**: Read the paragraph, then cover it with your hand and try remembering two or three facts.

**Be a journalist**: Think of yourself as a journalist: _"5W+H"_

- Who?
- What happened?
- Where did it happen?
