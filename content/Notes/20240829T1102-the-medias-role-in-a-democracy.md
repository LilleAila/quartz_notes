# the media's role in a democracy

In a democracy, the media allows for the exchange of ideas, opinions and information. It's independent from the government, and is often referred to "the fourth estate" or "the fourth power". The power is divided between different branches of government to prevent any single person from becoming too powerful. The US was the first country to attempt this after gaining independence from Great Britain. In the US, there are three branches of government:

- A legislative branch, which makes laws and controls the budget
  - Congress
    - House
    - Representatives and senate
- An executive branch, which does the day-to-day running of the country
  - President
  - Vice president
- A judiciary branch, which ensures that the laws are upheld
  - Supreme court
- The media, "the fourth estate"
  - "The peoples' watchdog"

This same system is being used around various countries in the world, including Norway.

The concept originates from the British parliament in the 1800s:

- The nobility
- The clergy
- The commoners

This is the current UK system:

- House of commons (lower house)
- House of lords (upper house)
- Queen / king

This is called a **Bicameral** system, where it's split in two.

The media functions as a sort of watchdog, by reporting the work done by the branches of the government. This helps people know what to vote in elections. The media reports on issues, and ensures that these issues are dealt with properly. The media works as an intermediate between the government and the people, so that the people know what is happening in the government, and the government knows what people want. The media has the explicit capacity of advocacy, and the implicit ability to frame political issues.

> "All power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely"

\- Charles Montesquieu, 18th century French Enlightenment philosopher

The best way we have found to avoid corruption is having a democracy where the power is split so that on one person has all the power.

It is important that a media is free to report the true facts, and should not have any influence from the government or any organizations. Politicians often place limits on the media, but it's ideal to have an entirely free press. Peoples' faith in the media is not very high today, because they're often run by smaller organizations and can contain biased information. It's becoming harder and harder to know what is true and not on the internet and in physical media, so it can be harder for people to trust it.
