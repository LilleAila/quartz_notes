# investigative journalism

The media is supposed to act as a watchdog and as a medium that allows people to know what is happening in the democracy and vice versa. The media helps us hold institutions in possession of power accountable for their actions. Some crimes would not have become public if the press hadn't intervened, investigated and published what they found out. **Media literacy** is important.

> Investigative journalism is a type of journalism that tries to discover information of public interest that someone is trying to hide
