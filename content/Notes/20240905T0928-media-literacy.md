# media literacy

> Media literacy is an expanded conceptualization of literacy that includes the ability to access and analyze media messages as well as create, reflect and take action, using the power of information and communication to make a difference in the world.

## Tips to improve media literacy

1. Think critically
   Think about the key ideas, the included _and excluded_ information, and if the content makes sense. (logos)
2. Be a smart consumer
   See if the content is credible and recognize that advertising attempts to be persuasive. (etos)
3. Recognize point of view
   Think about who is behind the presented content and why they published it - is it informative or trying to change your mind? (patos)
4. Be aware of the role of media in our culture
