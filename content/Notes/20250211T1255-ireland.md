## Potato famine: documentary

Potatoes:
Nutrient-rich
Easier for less rich families
Irelands more valuable agricultural products were exported
Most of the population (8 mill) lived entirely on potatoes
Potatoes were blackend and shiveled
People had stomach aches etc. from eating them
"Phytophtora infestans" - "blight"
Fungus originating form the Americas
Destroyed potato harvests across Europe

Ireland was almost entirely dependent
Class crisis
National catastrophe
1845: part of the United Kingdom
British imported corn from North America, offered employment on public work projects.
Less nutrition in the food
More prone to disease
British continued to export the grain and livestock from Ireland.

Thomas Malone

Many families managed to scrape by

1846: 75% impacted, blight
Government limited who was eligible for relief, increased taxes.

Policies stemming from religious policies stc.
British depicted as lazy, simple-minded alcoholics.
Famine was God's punishment for sinful behavior.
Not a lack of resources, but a lack of political will from the British.

1852, the weather returned to normal, and the potato crop stabilized.
1 million dies.
1-2 million emigrated
Halved population
With climate change, many more facing similar problems.

### Tasks

1. Why did John say the English created the Famine?

The famine was originally caused by a fungus called Phytophthora infestans, informally known as blight. This ruined their potato crop, causing the most important food source to disappear. In the beginning, they received some help from the British, importing corn from North America. However, this corn was not as nutritious as the potatoes they previously had. In addition, the British decided to limit who were eligible for this help, and did not give enough help. The impact of the famine could have been significantly decreased if the United Kingdom helped them more, as they did have the means to use it, but decided not to because of a lack of political will.

Kept exporting food form Ireland
Food of low nutrition imported from North America
Lack of quality control
Increased the taxes
Offered ineffective employment on public work projects

2. What were the main factors that led to the Irish Potato Famine? How did political, social, and economic conditions contribute to the crisis?

blight
climate
continued export
single food dependency

Social and economic class division
rich had it better
politics - exported the food from Ireland, leaving them with no food left.

3. How did the famine affect the population of Ireland in terms of mortality and emigration?

8.5 million
1 mill dies
2 mill emigradet
5.1 mill after the famine
Still emigrated after the famine because of fear
4.3 million
Today: 5.2 mill

4. What lessons can be learned from the Irish Potato Famine that are relevant to addressing food security and agricultural sustainability today?

To help out of compassion rather than meet them with judgement as the British did to the Irish during the famine.
Industry and climate change leading to unstable weather, which was one of the factors in the Irish famine.
