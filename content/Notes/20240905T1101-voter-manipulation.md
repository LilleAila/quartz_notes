# "Facebook's role in Brexit -- and the threat to democracy"

62% of people there voted to leave EU (Ebbw Vale)
They had a lot of expensive building funded by the European Union.
Vote to leave because "The EU had done nothing for them"
They "wanted to take back control"
Fed up with immigrants and refugees
Didn't meet any of them there at all, and it has one of the lowest rates of immigration of the country.
Had seen stuff about immigration on Facebook, especially about Turkey.
This was from ads they had seen
It all took place on Facebook, where only you could see the feed, and there are no records kept about it.
Facebook does have the answers, but didn't give the answers.
Multiple crimes took place on Facebook?
The amount of money they can spend on an election is limited so that no one can pay people to vote, but the referendum took place online, where you can spend any amount of money on ads without anyone knowing.
In the last days before the Brexit vote, a lot of money (3/4 of a million?) were used for ads illegally. "Vote Leave" brought a lot of misinformation about Turkey in the EU.
Facebook was forced to give the data.
It was the biggest electoral fraud in Britain for 100 year.

There were even more crimes committed. The group "Leave EU" broke laws. Arron Banks because the electoral commission didn't know where the money came from.
Trump and Brexit were connected?
Ads about immigration on Facebook.
"Cambridge Analytica" worked for both Trump and for Brexit and profiled people politically and individually, to better target them with Facebook ads. They harvested data from 87 million people on Facebook.
They got a lot of legal threats from both Cambridge Analytica and from Facebook, saying that they would sue them if it was published.
Facebook is a "crime scene", but doesn't want to share the evidence.
