# academic writing

- Structure (5-paragraph essay)
  - Introduction (1p)
  - Main body (>=3p)
  - Conclusion (1p)

Each paragraph has a topic sentence

Do not use literary devices in an academic essay!

Use facts, and avoid personal opinions.

Be objective - don't use phrases like "i think"

1. Prewriting: brainstorm - Venn diagrams, pros and cons, mind maps
2. Drafting: writer-centered, topic sentence-supporting sentences, linking words or phrases
3. Revising: reader-centered, check for typos, grammar and pretend you're a reader

- Don't use personal pronouns (I, we, you). These suggest your essay is an opinion instead of factual.
- Write in Present tense (mostly)
- Do not use rhetorical devices or creative writing skills.
- Do not use slang or informal language. (avoid contractions such as I'm (I am))

## General questions

Questions such as this, for example. It's important to always answer all the questions.

- How has the internet changed the way we communicate with each other?
  - What was communication like before the internet?
  - How is it different now?
  - Use examples!
- Do you think these changes are positive or negative?
  - Take a stance (it is mostly positive OR negative)
  - Show the other side too
- Why
  - Explain what makes you think it is one way or the other

Write an outline of the text:
Compare before/now with the internet
Table of the pros and cons of one of the sides

## Types of essays

Expository and argumentative essays:

Expository

- Explores several angles of a topic
- The thesis statement / thesis question presents the essay's topic
- Provides facts and explanations
- Mainly objective

Argumentative

- Chooses a position on a topic
- The thesis statement / thesis question presents the essay's main argument(s)
- Provides reasons for the author's argumentation (which may include facts / explanations)
- Mainly subjective

## Thesis statement

- The thesis statement is the main argument of your paper
- It seeks to answer and explore your central question
- It is usually one sentence that states your argument
- Most thesis statements appear at the end of the introduction, and again in the conclusion

When you are writing a thesis statement, ask yourself these questions to "check" yourself:

1. Do I answer the question?
2. Could a reasonable person disagree? - try disagreeing with yourself to find better arguments
3. Does my thesis pass the "so what" test?
4. Would an essay supporting this thesis be interesting?

Some examples of thesis questions / statements for an expository essay:

- What are some of the main contributing factors to climate change?
- Gun control is an issue that provokes strong feelings among Americans.
- What are some challenges immigrants to Britain face today?

Examples for an argumentative essay:

- Should vocational students spend less time in the classroom and more time getting work practice?
- Why must we fight climate change on behalf of future generations?
- The gun lobby must take the blame for school massacres in the USA.

Comparison (the second is better)

- This paper is about English as a global language.
- Although English is becoming an important language in Norway, it will not replace Norwegian.

Weak thesis statements are vague and state facts or observations that are obvious:

- This paper is about English as a global language.
- is English a global language?
- The UN is addressing poverty around the world.

Strong thesis statements take a stance and get specific (especially for argumentative essays):

- Although English is becoming and important language in Norway, it will not replace Norwegian.
- Many believe that the internet makes people less social, but it is actually a great way to maintain connections with friends and family.

### Task

Write a thesis statement or thesis question for the essay topic. The essay topic is very open and it is up to you to narrow them down by formulating suitable thesis questions / statements. You must figure out if you want to write an argumentative or an expository essay.

## Structure

### Introduction

Begin with something to capture your reader's interest, for example:

- A quotation: "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." (President John F. Kennedy in his inaugural speech.)
- A question: How many more school shootings will it take before the gun regulation laws are changed?
- A definition: Communication is defined as "the process by which information is exchanged between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs or behavior".
- A comparison: In July 2018 there were 12 prisoners on death row in Indiana. In the neighboring state of Illinois there were none.
- A familiar situation: Many people need a cup of coffee to get started in the morning. (Used in an argumentative essay about the coffee industry and Fairtrade.)
- An interesting fact: There are three times as many sheep as people in Australia. (Used in an expository essay about Australian culture.)
- A strong statement: President Trump is, perhaps surprisingly, not the worst that has happened to the USA in recent years.
- A common misconception: Most people have learned that humans have five senses. In reality, the number is probably between nine and twenty. (Used in an expository essay about myths related to the human body, an interdisciplinary assignment.)
- An anecdote: When Barack Obama took his wife-to-be out on a date, the car he drove was so run-down that she could see the ground through holes in the floor. (Used in an argumentative essay about the American Dream.)

## Task

- "There are so many more oppertunities now that you all have your own school pc" said Samuel's third grade teacher. He was 8 years old. He is 16 now, and he hasn't written on paper in 3 years

## The main body

Avoid any personal and subjective opinions, and use an objective point of view (unless it's an argumentative text), and don't use literary devices.

## Using examples

- You need to prove your argument to your reader with examples
- Good examples include facts, historical events, statistics, quotations (when looking at a piece of literature or analyzing a text)
- Good examples are specific
- Avoid using personal examples in an essay (unless the question asks you to reflect on your experience)

- It is not enough to simply state examples
- You also need to help your reader understand how your examples connect to your thesis statement and why they matter
- Remember the "example sandwich"
  - Introduce your example
  - Present your example
  - Analyze or reflect on your example

**One of the reasons Donald Trump is not qualified to be president is his racist assumptions about immigrants.** ==(Topic sentence)== _At one conference, he said that Mexicans are “bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime,” and he even suggested that many are “rapists.”_ ==(Example)== **Trump’s opinions are not based in the real life experiences of many immigrants, most of whom come to the United States seeking a safe and prosperous life. If Trump became president, his opinions would be more than just offensive. They would become actively dangerous to the American people.** ==(Analysis of examples)==

## Using linking words

## Conclusion

The conclusion is the final paragraph in your essay. The introduction leads the reader into the topic, while the conclusion leads the reader out. The thesis question is answered in the conclusion.

- Start with a topic sentence that links back to the topic of the essay. It does not have to be the first sentence in the paragraph, but it is a good idea to plan it first.

- Next, summarize the main points in the essay. Your main points should be found in the topic sentences from the body paragraphs. Try to show how your main points are answering your thesis question or discussing your thesis statement. You must avoid introducing new information in a conclusion.

- Finally, write a closing sentence. You can choose to end your essay in a number of ways, depending on what impression you want to leave your reader with.

### Closing sentence

A closing sentence can be for example:

![20240926T1109-closing-sentence.png](Assets/20240926T1109-closing-sentence.png)

Example:

As we have seen, football hooliganism in England has ==caused injuries== (sum up) to, and even deaths of, many innocent football fans. It has also ==led to riots== (sum up) in which shop owners have had their properties damaged or destroyed. ==However== (reflection), hooligan groups also seem to have filled the need for community for individuals and groups who haven’t been able to find this elsewhere in society. ==Overall== (sum up), it seems safe to say that the effects of hooliganism have been largely negative, giving football fans in England a bad reputation and tarnishing the game. However, ==behind every cloud there is a silver lining== (familiar saying, sun is behind a cloud, used when facing a bad situation, metaphor), and we can only hope that new efforts will be made to get rid of this scourge on ==“the beautiful game”==.

## Formal language

- All strong essays should be written in formal, academic language
- Avoid vague or general terms
  - Things, stuff, people, they say, get, make
  - Always clarify who you're talking about
- Avoid conversational phrases
  - Qualifiers: kind of, sort of, loads of
  - "I think" or "you know"
  - "Like"
