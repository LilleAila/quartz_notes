![20241015T1222-us-government-branches.png](Assets/20241015T1222-us-government-branches.png)

All of the three branches have the power to veto what each other do and to affect it, so that no one person has all the power.

The president nominates judges, and the supreme court can impeach the president.
The legislative branch (congress) confirms the nominations of judges by the presidents, and the President can veto congressional legislation. Additionally, the legislative branch makes laws and the budget.

### Legislative branch

- Congress
  - House of representatives
  - Senate

Each US state has two senators, with a total of 100 across the country.
Senators are elected for 6 years at a time. One third of the Senate is elected every two years.

Each state is divided into different congressional districts, based on the population. They are determined on a decennial census; it's conducted every ten years. (decade)
California has 52 congressional districts, because they have the biggest population in the US.
Alaska is geographically large, but only has 1 congressional district.
Maine has 2, and New York has 27. There are in total 435 congressional districts in the house of representatives.
In addition to these representatives, Washington DC has 3 representatives.
Representatives are elected for two years.

100 + 435 + 3 = 538
538 / 2 = 269

To win a presidential election, the presidential candidate needs 270 votes from senators and congressional districts in total, to have more than half.

It can pass laws over the president's veto and remove them from office. The Senate confirms the President's nominations, and can remove judges from office.
