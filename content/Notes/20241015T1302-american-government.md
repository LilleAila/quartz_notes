## Important numbers

100 : 50 states with 2 senators each in the senate

435 : congressional districts / representatives in the house of representatives
52 : congressional districts in California (proportional to the population)
1 : congressional districts in Alaska

438 : Representatives incl. Washington D.C. (3)

270 : Required votes to win the election (>half of 100+435+3)

9 : Justices (judges) in the supreme court (1 chief + 8 associate)

2 - 4 - 6 - lifelong : Term duration : House of representatives - President (max 2), Senators, Judges

## System of checks and balances

Legislative branch - Congress
Executive branch - President
Judicial branch - Supreme court

President nominates judges
The supreme court can declare presidential acts unconstitutional
The supreme court can impeach the president (?)

The supreme court can declare laws unconstitutional
The senate confirms the president's nominations, and can impeach judges.

The president can veto congressional legislation
The congress approves presidential nominations, and controls the budget
The congress can pass laws over the president's veto

All the three branches cannot make a decision alone; they have to agree with another branch.

## Growth of democracy

The founding documents:

- Declaration of Independence (1776)
- Constitution (1787)
- Bill of rights (1791)

The bill of rights extended the citizens' protections after the constitution did not offer enough protection against government abuse. It consists of 10 additional paragraphs to the constitution (amendments). It secures the right to free speech, the right to a fair trial and many others.

First, only rich white men were allowed to vote. In 1920, women were allowed to vote, and in 1965 it became illegal to deny anyone the right to vote on the basis of their race.

Central aspects of a democracy are fair and free elections, reliable and uncorrupt leaders, separation of powers and a free press.

In 2018, the USA dropped from "full democracy" to "flawed democracy" on the Democracy Index. Many were worried that Donald Trump's administration would damage the democracy of the country. He was accused of manipulating elections, attacking the press, lying and being corrupt. This is one of the reasons that the system of checks and balances exists.

Money plays a big role in elections. This can give donors a big influence over politics. This can discourage people from voting. Americans are complaining that politicians are not doing their job. In one instance, it took over a year to appoint a new judge to the Supreme Court, because the president and congress didn't agree.

American democracy has been slow in recent years, in addition to people being discouraged from voting because of its role in elections. In 2000 and 2016, George W. Bush and Donald Trump respectively won the election without getting a majority of the votes.

## Manipulation and gerrymandering

gerry: the name of a governor
mander: an animal; salamander
from when gerry manipulated the borders, making them look similar to the animal

Gerrymandering is when the borders or population of the electoral district are changed to manipulate the outcome in terms of representatives.

"winner takes all" in presidential elections, means that the candidate with the majority of the states will get _all_ their representatives and senators. If the population of a state is 20 million, and one side gets 12 million of the votes, that means that the side with the majority, gets all of the 54 electors.

An electoral _precinct_ is the smallest unit electoral districts are divided in.

## Constitution

British were tyrannical
Took a lot of taxes
US could not send representatives to parliament

## Notes from text

### The birth of American democracy

Why?
Tyrannical rulers from England, so they didn't get a lot of freedom
Could not send their own representatives to the Parliament in London
An unfair amount of taxes from Britain

When?
1775-1783 war
1776 4. Jul declaration of independence

What?
Constitution: freedom, indirect election, 1787

How?
Two-layered system:
Federal, central government
State, local governments

Declaration of independence on 4 July 1776.
Seven years of war, "American War of Independence" (1775-1783), colonists won over British troops
Representatives from 13 colonies agreed on a basic structure and principles for the nation.
Founders wrote constitution in 1787.
\- Humans have the right to freedom and to indirectly rule themselves through elected representatives
The constitution limited the power of the government to protect the rights of the citizens.

### Federalism

One strong central government, for things that are impractical or impossible for local levels of government
For example trade between states, defending the nation, international affairs
The local governments are responsible for what happens in their area with the people who live in those states. In addition, different states have different taxes, because it's decided locally.

Separated sovereignty between federal government and local government

Still debated
Obama state-funded insurance "Obamacare" in 2010 was a "government takeover of health care"

There is a lot of power left to individual states, leading to for example that the federal government has not passed strict gun control laws or abolished the death penalty. There is a lot of diversity between the fifty states because of this.

The government is separated into three branches. That system of checks and balances makes sure that political decisions are never made by a single person.

### The legislative branch

The congress
Divided into two houses: house of representatives and senate
House of representatives: 435 members
Decided based on the population of each state. California has 52, while Alaska has 1, even though they are geographically similarly sized.
Representatives from the House of Representatives serve two-year terms.

Each state has two senators, for a total of 100 senators in the US. In addition, Washington DC has 3 representatives, for a total of 538 across the two houses.

270 of them are required to vote for a presidential candidate to be elected (more than half)
