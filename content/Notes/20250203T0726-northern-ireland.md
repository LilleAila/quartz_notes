### Why divided?

Until 1920, the island of Ireland was a colony of the UK
Majority of Irish population wanted full independence.
Agreed in 1921, signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty
Split the island in two: a large Irish Free State with a certain independence, and a smaller section in the northeast that would remain part of the UK.
Full Irish independence in 1949, Irish Free State became the Republic of Ireland.

Some are in favor of reunification, and want one Ireland. Nationalists / Republicans
Some others want NI to stay in the union with the UK. Unionists / Loyalists

### Why religion

King Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church in early 1530s
Established the Anglican Church, the Protestant church.
Was then allowed to divorce the queen.

Britain became more and more protestant. (but with many conflicts)
Ireland at the same time remained Catholic

Henry VIII and daughter Elizabeth wanted to colonize Ireland.
Protestant English and Scottish settlers were sent to Ireland (called planters)

Protestants were originally English, and felt protected by a strong connection to the British Crown.
The Irish Catholics saw the British settlers as intruders.

Catholic: In favor of one united and independent Ireland.
Protestant: In favor of staying in a union with Great Britain, loyal to the British monarch.

### The Troubles

The Protestant majority in Northern Ireland have gotten the best jobs, housing and schools.
Discrimination, causing anger in the Catholic minority

Catholic protest marches, met with violence from Protestants
Catholics responded with more violence, and bombs and killings occurred.
British troops were sent in to restore peace.
That made it worse.
Both sides of the conflict had terrorist organizations involved.
Irish Republican Army (IRA) fighting for an independent, united ireland since the War of Independence (1919-21)
Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) on the other side

1972: 26 Catholics in a peaceful march were shot by British soldiers, 14 died.
"Bloody Sunday", a turning point in the conflict.
Northern Ireland was close to civil war.
IRA carried out bombings and other terrorist attacks in Britain during 1970s-1980s, to force the government ot let them unite with the Republic of Ireland.

### The conflict

More than 3500 lives were claimed.
Both sides knew there would be no winners.
Politicians began working for reconciliation
1998: Good Friday Agreement signed.
Situation has been relatively peaceful since then.
Terror organizations on both sides have handed in their weapons.

The peace treaty restored a degree of political autonomy to the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast.
Political system such that unionists and republicans are fairly represented.
At times hard, and the Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended at times.
Sometimes, violence flares up, for example in April 2019 when a journalist was killed during riots.

### Situation now

The majority wants the country to remain part of the UK

Some Catholics with intensely for Northern Ireland to be united with the Republic of Ireland, others do not.
Currently, Northern Ireland governs many of its own affairs, but remains part of the UK as an attempt at compromise between opposing views.

Still divided.
Catholics live in Catholic areas, go to Catholic schools.
Protestants live in other areas and go to state schools.

In some housing areas, Catholics and Protestants live side by side, and more and more children go to "integrated schools", attempting to balance the numbers.

The economy of Northern Ireland has been weak, largely as a result of the Troubles.

Tourism is on the rise in Northern Ireland. Tourist attractions include:

- The historic cities of Belfast, Derry and Armagh
- The Titanic Belfast visitor centre
- The Giant's Causeway World Heritage Site
- Medieval castles

### Brexit

In Northern Ireland, the "Remain" side won, but the population is very divided.

The majority of Catholics voted Remain
The Protestants were more divided

People identify less and less with the division between Catholic and Protestants.

1998: 40% unionist, 25% nationalist, 33% neither.
2018: 50% neither, even higher among younger people

There was no visible border between Ireland and Britain, because they were both members of the EU.
This was closer to a united Ireland.

### Presentation

> What were the Troubles, and why has there been so much violence in Northern Ireland?

The Protestant majority in Northern Ireland have gotten the best jobs, housing and schools.
This discrimination and difference between the two caused anger in the Catholic minority of Northern Ireland
The conflict started in the 1960s

Catholics protested in marches, which were met with violence from Protestants.
They were in turn met with violence back from the Catholics.
From this, many bombs were used, and killings occurred during the Troubles.

Following the violence, British troops were sent in to restore the peace in Northern Ireland.
However, this attempt at peace made the situation worse, pouring more fuel on the fire.
On both sides of the conflict, there were terrorist organizations involved.
This included the Provisional Irish Republican Army, or the IRA, and the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), who were fighting for a united, independent Ireland ever since the War of Independence from 1919 to 1921.
On the loyalist side, the Ulster Volunteer Force (the UVF), and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), fought for Northern Ireland remaining as a part of the United Kingdom.

In 1972, during a peaceful march organized by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, 26 unarmed Catholics were shot by British soldiers. As a result, 14 of the people died, and 15 others were wounded.
The event became known as the "Bloody Sunday", and was a turning point in the conflict.
It the incident during the Troubles with the largest number of civilians killed.
After this, Northern Ireland was on the verge of civil war.

The IRA carried out more bombings and other terrorist attacks in Britain during 1970s-1980s, to force the government to let them unite with the Republic of Ireland.

This conflict became known as the Troubles
